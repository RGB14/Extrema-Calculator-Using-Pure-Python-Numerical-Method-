###---CODE VERSIONS---###

There are 2 versions of code:
1. Numerical_Solution_v1 -> which uses direct method to solve the problems using methods
2. Numerical_Solution_v2 -> which iterates over an interval

Due to completexity, the code is incomplete and was tough to build as there was no library used.
However, with library, it could have been in a few lines.

###---HOW TO RUN SCRIPT---###

1) Download Python Library and compiler from
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe

During installation, check Add Python 3.8 to PATH
At the end, Disable the PATH Limit

2) Open any Terminal or Command Prompt and use 'cd' command to redirect to the assignment folder

3) After redirection, use 'python numerical_solution_v1.py' to run the script 
			----OR----
			use 'python_numerical_solution_v2.py' 


I hope you will kindly give me some marks for this hardwork even though it was unsuccessful.
Thank you.
